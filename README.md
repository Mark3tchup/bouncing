# bouncing
The bouncing DVD logo, now on your terminal.

Have you ever used DVD players? If so, probably you remember what happened
when you didn't use them for a while. Yeah, that legendary logo, moving
along the entire TV screen... and bouncing, sometimes.

Well, **bouncing** (the program, not the action) shows a DVD logo that
bounces and moves along your terminal, just like those iconic players
(only if you consider that to be a DVD logo, of course).


## How do I try it?

First, clone this repository from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Mark3tchup/bouncing.git
```

Then run:

```shell
cd ./bouncing/
make
./bouncing
```

...and enjoy.


## Is bouncing useful? Can I use it as a screensaver?

On the first question: haha, not much. bouncing is just a toy I'm using
to learn how to control the TTY behavior.

On the other one: of course you can!
